00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02.042
(Music starts playing)

00:00:03.167 --> 00:00:07.025
I believe that at the person level, there are 4 skills that I master.

00:00:10.026 --> 00:00:15.042
especially when creating attractive designs that make navigation more pleasant

00:00:16.167 --> 00:00:21.025
always taking from reference other designs that in my opinion are fabulous

00:00:23.167 --> 00:00:27.025
Secondly, I believe that other skills are empathy.

00:00:29.167 --> 00:00:39.025
Because in any type of situation, but mainly the difficult ones, I try to put myself in the shoes of others in order to help them as best as possible.

00:00:40.167 --> 00:00:45.025
On the other hand, the third, I think it would be, the ability to work in a group.

00:00:46.167 --> 00:00:53.025
Since I have always believed that the success of a job lies in sharing the necessary tasks among the different components of the group

00:00:55.167 --> 00:00:59.025
And last but not least, would be project management.

00:01:01.167 --> 00:01:09.025
where for me, active listening to the client prevails as long as you want to achieve satisfactory results when creating a project
